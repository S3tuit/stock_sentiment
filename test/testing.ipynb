       "'    NiseriN/iStock via Getty Images Macquarie Equity Research started coverage on bitcoin (BTC-USD) miners Riot Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT), MARA Holdings (NASDAQ:MARA), CleanSpark (NASDAQ:CLSK) and Cipher Mining (NASDAQ:CIFR) in a recent note on the expectation that the fundamental drivers backing bitcoin\\'s price appreciation \"could continue, if not accelerate, making BTC production accretive vs. equity issued to grow.\" Cipher (CIFR) shares rose markedly on the upbeat coverage, jumping 18% in Wednesday morning trading. Meanwhile, Riot (RIOT) gained 1.2%, MARA (MARA), formerly known as Marathon Digital, edged up 0.2%, and CleanSpark (CLSK) advanced 1.9%. Note that bitcoin (BTC-USD) also trended higher at press time, rising 0.8% to $63.7K. The fundamental drivers that analyst Paul Golding referred to include \"loose fiscal policy, loosening monetary policy, fears of sovereign debt crises, capital controls, geopolitical unrest, institutional value transfers, cross-border payments, web3, and more.\" Also, \"the concentration of commodity resources — power infrastructure, compute, and bandwidth — in our view, represent tangible value beyond forecast appreciation in bitcoin,\" he wrote in a Tuesday note.  The analyst pointed out that some bitcoin (BTC-USD) miners are increasingly shifting to high-performance computing infrastructure for artificial intelligence to boost their revenue.  \"But operationalizing AI cloud offerings from bitcoin miners\\' facilities is still nascent,\" he noted. \"If the hyperscale landscape, in search of compute now, broadly warms up to miners, we could see this value play materializing in a potentially big way.\" Seeking Alpha\\'s Peer page compares numerous metrics of the aforementioned stocks.  More on Cipher Mining, CleanSpark, etc.  Cipher Mining\\'s Capital Hoard, Q2 Earnings MARA Holdings Is Turning Into A Leveraged Bitcoin Fund Riot Platforms Offers Asymmetric Upside Potential At Full Capacity Bitfarms agrees to board changes in settlement with Riot Platforms  '"
